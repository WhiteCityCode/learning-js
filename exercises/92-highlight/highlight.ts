/**
 * You're building a search engine and one of the first tasks is to

 *
 * In order to do this, you need to write a function that takes a string
 * and a search term and returns a new string with the search term
 * wrapped in a <mark> tag.
 *
 * Example:
 * highlight('This is a test', 'test') // => 'This is a <mark>test</mark>'
