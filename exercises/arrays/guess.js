/**
 * Write a guessing game where:
 *
 * 1. You get some random number N, where 0 <= N <= 100
 * 2. You get an array of M guesses, where 0 < M < 100
 * 3. If any of the guesses it's a match, return the
 *    index of the element in the array, otherwise -1
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * With the array of guesses being [1, 2, 10, 5] and the
 * random number being 10, the program should return 3 (third
 * element in the guessing array)
