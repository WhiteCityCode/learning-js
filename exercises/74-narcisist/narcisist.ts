// A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits,
// each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base.

// For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcisstic:

//     1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

// and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

//     1⁴ + 6⁴ + 5⁴ + 2⁴ = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16

export const isNarcisist = (N: number): boolean => {
  return true;
