/**
 * In order to stop the mad coder evil genius, you need to decypher the message
 * he sent to his evil minions. The message contains several numbers that,
 * when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missle into the sky, blocking
 * out the sun. This will make everyone sad and grumpy. We can't have that!
 *
 * Luckily, you figured out that he modifies a single digit on the numbers he
 * sends. More specifically, in the given number n, the k-th bit from left to
 * right was swapped.
 *
 * It's up to you to figure out the function that finds these numbers.
 *
 * Example:
 * n = 37 = 100101, k = 2 -> 100001 = 33
