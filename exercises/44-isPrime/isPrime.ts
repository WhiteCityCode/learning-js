// Your function takes n, a positive integer as an argumet and should return
// a boolean value representing the fact that a number is prime or not.
// A prime number is a number that is exactly divisible only to 1 and itself.
// Example:
// 6 -> false (6 is divisible with 1, 2, 3 and 6)
// 11 -> true (11 is only divizible only with 1 and 11)

export const isPrime = (n: number): boolean => {
  return false;
};
