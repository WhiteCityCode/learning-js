/**
 * Implement a function that works like React's `useState` hook.
 * The way this works is that it allows you to keep track and modify a value
 * over time.
 *
 * Calling it returns a tuple of a getter and a setter function:
 *
 * const [getCount, setCount] = useState(0);
 *
 * In this example, calling `getCount()` will return `0`, and `setCount` would
 * allow setting a different value such that calling `setCount(10)` would mean
 * that`getCount()` now returns `10`.
