//J amie is a beginner programmer. He wants to surprise his girlfriend with
// a diamond, but couldn't afford one and he also can't code one. Help James out
// Your task is to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed
// on the screen, using * (asterisk) characters. Trailing spaces must be
// eliminated and each line must end with a \n (newline) character.
// If you receive a negative or even number, return an empty string, as it
// is impossible to make diamonds out of negative or even values.

// Example:
// 3 ->
//  *
// ***
//  *
// which would appear as the string " *\n***\n *\n"

// 5 ->
//   *
//  ***
// *****
//  ***
//   *
// which would appear as the string "  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n"
